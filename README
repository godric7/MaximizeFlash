blue areas. Click on the area you want to be maximized, and viola!
To go back, just press the button again.

When to use it:
Anytime you feel like size matters, but more specifically,

- For flash games.
If, like everyone else, you enjoy playing games on the internet but feel like playing on a cell phone screen. MaximizeFlash along with the Chrome built-in borderless fullscreen feature allows you to play fullscreen !

- With a dual screen setup.
If you watch videos from sites like YouTube and Megavideo with more than one display. You may have noticed that using these sitesâ€™ fullscreen features makes your monitor borders ruin everything, or that it's turned off when you click somewhere on your other screen. MaximizeFlash and the Chrome built-in fullscreen feature stays on, even when you click somewhere else.
